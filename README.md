# Facial Keypoints Detection
* The notebook contains an implementation of facial keypoint detection using Keras.
* The data I used for this project is the "facial keypint detection" competition, from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection.
* The data contains images (train and test) and 30 types of keypoints labels for the train data only, that the model will learn to predict for the test images.
